This code has been extracted from 
http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Gregoire.Malandain/diameter/

IMPORTANT::==============================================
The  following code replacements has been made:

estimateDiameterInOneList (and possible all other 3 methods) crashes with all points the same
since _MaximalSegmentInOneList does not generate a feasible segment (pointers are zero)
because it compares the newdistance to 0.0 since the squareDiameter was initialized to 0.0
resulting in never updating the segement!

nice fix is to set the initialization code for ->squareDiameter = 0.0  to lowest number!
Search: 
->squareDiameter\s*=\s*(0\.0|0|\.0)
Replace
squareDiameter = std::numeric_limits<double>::lowest();

=================================================================

The original read me was:

DESCRIPTION 
-----------

This is a little package containing code
for diameter computation of points sets (see references below).

Compiling 
---------
% make

Programs
--------
'diameter-test' computes the diameter (or an epsilon-approximation)
   of a points set, that can be randomly picked, or read from a file.
'gener-points' generates a file from a ramdom distribution. Its output
   can be read by 'diameter-test'

The '-help' option will provide you with the full options of these
two programs.

Examples
--------

% gener-points -dist c -p 100 -dim 4 cube.pts
generates the file 'cube.pts' that contains 100 points 
distributed inside a cube in R^4

% diameter-test cube.pts
computes the diameter of the points contained in file 'cube.pts'

The same can be directly done by
% diameter-test -dist c -p 100 -dim 4
